## Server Software

The Daring Fireball website is hosted by [Joyent].

Articles and links are published through [Movable Type]. In addition to my own SmartyPants and Markdown plug-ins, Daring Fireball uses several excellent Movable Type plug-ins, including Brad Choate’s [MT-Regex] and [MT-IfEmpty], and [Nat Irons’s Amputator].

Stats are tracked using [Mint]. Additional web nerdery, including the membership system, is fueled by [Perl], [PHP], and [MySQL].

## Web Standards

Web standards are important, and Daring Fireball adheres to them. Specifically, Daring Fireball’s HTML markup should validate as either [HTML 5] or XHTML 4.01 Transitional, its layout is constructed using [valid CSS], and its syndicated feed is [valid Atom].

If Daring Fireball looks goofy in your browser, you’re likely using a shitty browser that doesn’t support web standards. Internet Explorer, I’m looking in your direction. If you complain about this, I will laugh at you, because I do not care. If, however, you are using a modern, standards-compliant browser and have trouble viewing or reading Daring Fireball, please do let me know.
