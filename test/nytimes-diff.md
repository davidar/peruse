Hundreds of terrified parents arrived as their sobbing children were led out of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in a wooded corner of Newtown, Conn. By then, all of the victims had been shot and most were dead, and the gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, had committed suicide. The children [-who were-] killed were said to be [-between 5 and-] {+5 to+} 10 years old.

A 28th person, found dead in a house in the town, was also believed to have been shot by Mr. Lanza. That victim, one law enforcement official said, was Mr. Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza, [-a teacher-] {+who worked+} at the school. She apparently owned the guns he used.

The [-school-] principal had buzzed Mr. Lanza in because she recognized him as the son of a colleague. Moments later, she was shot dead when she went to investigate the sound of gunshots. The school psychologist was also among those who died.

Law enforcement officials said Mr. Lanza had grown up in Newtown, and he was remembered by high school classmates as smart, introverted and nervous. They said he had gone out of his way [-to not-] {+not to+} attract attention when he was younger.

The gunman was chillingly accurate. A spokesman for the State Police said [-that only one person had been injured-] {+he left only one wounded survivor+} at the school. All the others hit by the barrage of bullets from the guns Mr. Lanza carried — the rifle was similar to a weapon [-widely used-] {+used widely+} by troops in Afghanistan and Iraq — died, suggesting that they were shot at point-blank range. One law enforcement official said the shootings occurred in two classrooms in a section of the single-story Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Law enforcement officials offered no hint of what {+had+} motivated Mr. Lanza. It was also unclear, one investigator said, why Mr. Lanza — after shooting his mother to death inside her home — drove her car to the school and slaughtered the children. “I don’t think anyone knows the answers to those questions at this point,” the official said. As for a possible motive, he added, “[-We-]{+we+} don’t know much for sure.”

In the cold light of Friday morning, faces told the story outside the stricken school. There were the frightened faces of children who were crying as they were led out in a line. There were the grim faces of [-three women who emerged with their arms around one another, as if they were protecting the one in the middle.-] {+women.+} There were the relieved-looking faces of a couple and [-a little girl in a light blue jacket, riding high on her father’s shoulders.-] {+their little girl.+}
