## Snopes fact checker and staff writer David Emery posted to Twitter asking if there were “any un-angry Trump supporters?”

Emery, a writer for partisan “fact-checking” website Snopes.com which soon will be in charge of labelling [“fake news”] alongside ABC News and Politifact, retweeted an article by Vulture magazine relating to the [protests] of the *Hamilton* musical following the decision by the cast of the show to make a [public announcement] to Vice-president elect Mike Pence while he watched the performance with his family.

The tweet from Vulture magazine reads, “[\#Hamilton] Chicago show interrupted by angry Trump supporter.” Emery retweeted the story, saying, “Are there un-angry Trump supporters?”

This isn’t the first time the Snopes.com writer has expressed anti-Trump sentiment on his Twitter page. In another tweet in which Emery links to an article that falsely attributes a quote to President-elect Trump, Emery states, “Incredibly, some people actually think they have to put words in Trump’s mouth to make him look bad.”

Emery also retweeted an article by *New York* magazine that claimed President-elect Trump relied on lies to win during his campaign and that we now lived in a “post-truth” society. “Before long we’ll all have forgotten what it was like to live in the same universe; or maybe we already have,” Emery tweeted.

Facebook believe that Emery, along with other Snopes writers, ABC News, and [Politifact] are impartial enough to label and silence what they believe to be “fake news” on social media.
