Most people know that Earth’s landmasses once formed single supercontinent, but how said continent peeled away from itself – or the extent to which Earth’s continents remain connected – is not always immediately apparent. That’s where the Dymaxion map comes in.

The Dymaxion map sprang from the mind of architect/inventor/futurist Buckminster Fuller. Writer Alvin Toffler [once called Fuller] “one of the most-powerful myth-makers and myth-exposers of our time… a controversial, constructive, endlessly energetic metaphor-maker who sees things differently from the rest of us, and thereby makes us see ourselves afresh.”Indeed, anyone familiar with Fuller, his [ideas] or [his inventions] knows he had a certain special way of looking at the world.

In the case of the actual, literal world, that way involved projecting it onto an icosahedron and unfolding it into two-dimensions to reveal the planet’s continents as “one island” of near-contiguous land masses:

Fuller’s is what is commonly called a [compromise projection], a map that [forfeits certain geographic parameters in favor of others] (the popular *West Wing* scene featured here explores some of the tradeoffs made in the name of map-making).

Like other compromise projections, the Dymaxion map attempts to preserve the relative size and shape of the planet’s assorted land masses, [distortions the more common Mercator and Peters projections struggle with, respectively].

One particularly noteworthy feature of the Dymaxion map is its ability to be re-assembled and unfolded in a new configuration. Unfolding it in one way emphasizes the near-contiguous landmass featured above. Unfolding it another, however, gives you an icosahedral net with a global ocean surrounded by land.

According to the [Buckminster Fuller Institute], Fuller worked on this map for decades before it came into being in 1954. When it did, he believed he had finally realized a “satisfactory deck plan of the six and one half sextillion tons [Spaceship Earth].” (“Spaceship Earth” being a wonderful concept that relates our planet to a spaceship flying through the cosmos.)
